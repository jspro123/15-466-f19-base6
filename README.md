Notes of interest:

- Because I was pretty busy this week, and because I didn't have a strong image of any game I wanted to build...yeah.
- I wanted to make a spooky game where the camera keeps staticking, and the player keeps teleporting around and seeing double,
  for what it's worth. With some voice-over, I reckon it would have barely been a game.

This game was built with [NEST](NEST.md).
